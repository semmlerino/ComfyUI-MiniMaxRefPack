"""Drag-and-drop file routing, as the shipped browser code actually decides it.

Dropped files are sorted by what they ARE, not by where the pointer landed, which is
what lets one gesture fill all three sections. The router is extracted from
web/refpack.js between its MMRP-DROP markers and executed under node, so this tests
the shipped code rather than a copy of it that can drift out from under the tests.

SCOPE, honestly: this covers the pure router only. The drag listeners, the
preventDefault that stops ComfyUI hijacking the drop into a LoadImage node, and
addFiles' caps and uploads are NOT exercised here - they need a real browser.
