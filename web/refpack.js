/**
 * MiniMax References Manager — native widgets (openrouter_api_key, model) stay on top,
 * untouched; everything custom lives in one DOM block BELOW them. Per the visual
 * spec the DOM/canvas split is VISIBLE: no wrapping panel, buttons and prompt sit
 * directly on ComfyUI's grey node body, and the canvas is a BLACK slab that
 * announces "this is the reference area":
 *   [⬆ Image] [⬆ Video] [⬆ Audio] [Save config] [Load config] · · · · · · · [⚙]
 *   <canvas> — black; Images (N/9) / Videos (N/3) / Audio (N/3), three fixed
 *              sections separated by drawn divider lines, a "+" add slot per row
 *   Prompt — one large plain textarea (bound to the hidden `direction` widget)
 *   Original prompt — a second textarea (bound to hidden `original_prompt`) that
 *                     keeps the idea Auto Prompt rewrote away from `direction`
 * The ⚙ opens a modal for the `system_prompt` widget — never drawn on the node body,
 * only editable behind that modal (see openSystemPromptModal).
 *
 * FIXED SIZE, per spec: "I would like this node to have a fixed size that cannot be
 * moved" / "I don't want the canvas to change at all — always the same row. It just
 * adds or removes content." So: node.resizable = false, and onResize / setSize /
 * computeSize all clamp to fixedSize() regardless of input — a restored workflow, a
 * paste, or a frontend quirk cannot put the node at another size. The three rows are
 * always drawn at full tile height whether they hold 0 or 9 items; only their
 * CONTENTS change. Every piece of machinery that existed to cope with a changing
 * size (content measurement, resize-driven relayout, width floors, the
 * restored-size protection) is deleted — the geometry below is arithmetic over
 * constants, not measurement.
 *
 * RENDERING: the reference rows are a single <canvas>, not per-cell DOM — the LTX
 * Director hybrid (ltx_director.js draws its timeline onto one canvas at :2703 but
 * keeps buttons and the prompt as real DOM). Per-cell DOM kept producing
 * overlap/leakage bugs on this frontend; one drawn surface has nothing to overlap.
 * Everything inside the rows — headers, thumbnails, tag badges, delete, the
 * soundtrack toggle, the add slots, play glyphs, selection — is painted by draw(),
 * the single entry point. No requestAnimationFrame loop: scheduleDraw() coalesces
 * change events (refs, selection, thumb load, probe answer, preview state, the
 * canvas's one real mount via a ResizeObserver) into at most one paint per frame,
 * and draw() never calls setSize/computeSize, so paint can't recurse into layout.
 *
 * PLAYABLE PREVIEWS: click the drawn ▶ on a video or audio tile to play it, click
 * again (or click the playing video) to stop. ONE shared <video> overlay and ONE
 * shared <audio> element per node — never per-cell DOM. The overlay is a child of
 * the block, so ComfyUI's zoom transform applies to it automatically; positioning
 * is plain CSS-px math off the tile rect. Clicking a tile anywhere OUTSIDE the ▶
 * selects it, exactly as before.
 *
 * HIDING `references_json`, `direction` and `system_prompt`: mirrors WhatDreamsCost
 * multi_image_loader.js's hide-widget pattern (:122-146) — a plain `w.hidden = true`
 * gets silently overwritten on V3 (vueNodesMode), which re-derives widget visibility
 * from `hidden`/`type` on every reactive redraw, and a widget left with its native
 * computeSize reserves real layout height: three stacked, that read as a thin bar
 * overlapping our controls. The fix: Object.defineProperty-lock `hidden`/`type` as
 * always-on getters V3's own writes can't override, set computeSize = [0,0]
 * unconditionally, and poll every 50ms for 1s for `w.element` — V3 creates the DOM
 * element backing a multiline STRING widget ASYNCHRONOUSLY, so a one-shot
 * display:none misses it. Every property hideWidget() touches is try/catch-wrapped:
 * a prior version of this file assigned `domWidget.node = node` directly, which is a
 * getter-only accessor on the V3 frontend's BaseWidget and threw a TypeError that
 * aborted loading ANY workflow containing this node — fatal, not cosmetic. That
 * assignment is gone (the node is captured via closure instead); hideWidget()'s own
 * property writes are defensive against the same class of bug.
 *
 * Each video tile carries a soundtrack MUTE (bottom-left: ♪ on a light chip when on,
 * a struck-through speaker when muted, plus a "muted" badge line) — it's the only
 * thing that routes that video's audio to its index-matched video_audio_N output, so
 * it's real functionality, not decoration. The edit modal repeats it as a worded
 * "Soundtrack: on/muted" button. Gated on GET /minimax_refpack/probe?file=
 * (media.py's has_audio — a DECODABLE track): dim/pending until the probe answers,
 * permanently disabled for a clip with no audio track. See probeHasAudio()/
 * syncProbes() and drawTile().
 *
 * USE AUDIO ONLY: the mirror chip (bottom-right, speaker + out-arrow) and the edit
 * modal's "Audio only" button replace a video reference with an AUDIO reference to
 * the same file (videoToAudioOnly, the MMRP-AUDIO-ONLY seam): <Audio n>, no <Video k>,
 * trim and audio roles kept. The Audio row's upload/picker accept video files too;
 * such a tile says "video soundtrack" (or "video · no audio track", with the danger
 * border) on its badge. Canvas hover titles name every chip's action (hitTitle).
 *
 * NOT SURFACED ON THE NODE BODY: the system prompt itself — lives only behind the ⚙
 * modal (openSystemPromptModal), never drawn on the body.
 *
 * CROP + TRIM (openEditModal): one modal edits both. Entry points: the scissors chip
 * in a tile's TOP-LEFT corner (the only free corner — delete owns top-right, ♪ sits
 * bottom-left above the badge, ▶ is centred) and a double-click anywhere on the tile.
 * The modal shows the REAL media via /view (fileUrl) — an <img> for stills, a <video>
 * for clips — with a draggable fraction-space crop rect + corner handles and aspect
 * presets; video/audio get in/out trim handles on a bar plus 2dp second fields. Each
 * row ends in a right-aligned Clear button ("Clear crop" / "Clear trim") that resets
 * that edit — dimmed when there is nothing to clear, so the modal states at a glance
 * whether the reference carries an edit; clearing the crop also releases the aspect
 * lock and unhighlights every preset. No preset is highlighted on open — the highlight
 * means the user chose a lock, not the free default. Save
 * writes crop ([x,y,w,h] fractions) / trim ([start,end] seconds) onto the reference —
 * refs.py validates and media.py applies them — and drops the file's thumbCache entry
 * so the tile redraws from the thumb route with the edit baked in. The scissors chip
 * inverts to a light chip while an edit is set (same signalling as ♪), the badge grows
 * a third line ("2.00-6.50s · cropped"), and the click-to-play preview plays only the
 * trimmed span (seek to the in-point, timeupdate stops it at the out-point). All of it
 * keeps the module invariants: no per-cell DOM, one shared <video>/<audio> per node,
 * scheduleDraw coalescing, no requestAnimationFrame loop.
